<h1>What Is This?</h1>
JavaScript Bookmarklets that can run on any website by clicking on them, and we have some scripts that need the dev console (Ctrl+Shift+i)
<h2>How do i make them?</h2>
I use a website that turns javascript more complicated, to go to the website, click <a href="https://caiorss.github.io/bookmarklet-maker/">here</a>, and <a href="https://bookmarklets.org/maker/">this</a>
